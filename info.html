            <h1>Balloons</h1>
            <p>There are many types of bloons in the game ranging from the harmless red balloons to 
                the giant BAD balloons. The bloons travel along the track at various speeds and 
                higher class bloons can take more hits before being popped. It is important to have
                a strong defense in the game to stop the bloons getting through in later rounds.

                Not all monkeys are equal, some do more damage or shoot faster. Some monkeys known as "support monkeys"
                are able to slow down or completely stun bloons, delaying them from reaching the exit.
